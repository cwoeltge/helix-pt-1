Adobe and Netcentric are incredibly excited to have you join us for a transformational learning and networking experience in Girona, Spain. The workshops will be led by Alex Depledge and Priya Lakhani, two dynamic women who successfully built and sold their own tech companies.
A few things you will learn: how women can lead so others will follow; using diversity to drive innovation; how to speak the language of the ‘board’ and deliver shareholder value; how to get ‘buy-in’ from multiple stakeholders within the organization; how to navigate the politics and build consensus; how to structure teams to empower them; what is AI and what can it do for your business; and how marketing technology can truly deliver an holistic Customer Experience.
Our goal is to help inspire you personally and professionally through an open-minded and open-hearted experience. Fed by the science of physiology and neurobiology to achieve a heightened mental state to learn and ideate, we look forward to engaging with you in thought provoking conversations amongst like-minded female peers and leaders.

## The Speakers

### Alex Depledge MBE

Leaving her job at Accenture for the uncertainty of a startup, Alex and her friend Jules started Hassle.com. The pair got through the challenges, the mistakes, and the lack of investment to build a company that sold for over £20million. They’re repeated the process with Resi, a disruptive architecture and planning business. Alex looks at the lessons for other startups and those wanting to emulate them, as well as how the tech sector is performing, the sharing and gig economies, and what the future holds for brands and consumers.

### Priya Lakhani OBE

After giving up a career in law to pursue a dream of running her own business, Priya built and sold a successful food brand. She then established a social enterprise before starting a tech company that brings together AI and education in order to understand how students learn and provide educators with an insight into how to create personalised education.

### Bridget Perry

Bridget has been leading businesses in the high-tech industry for more than 18 years across digital marketing, enterprise, B2B, B2C, demand generation, campaign, solutions, partner, executive, customer and account-based marketing. For almost six years as VP of Enterprise Marketing, she led Adobe's marketing to enterprise companies globally.
